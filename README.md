# Orchid command-line

This folder contains a command-line version of the Orchid application.

## Building

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

`npm start` will start the proxy and launch Chrome.

## TODO

- This code is mostly copy-and-pasted from the /index.js file in orchid-desktop. Things should be refactored to get rid of this code duplication.
- The user data directory is hard-coded
